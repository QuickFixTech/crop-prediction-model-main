Welcome to our project on crop recommendation using machine learning! In this project, we

have developed a system that helps farmers make informed decisions about which crops to grow 

based on various factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels in the soil, as well as

environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, our system predicts which

crops are most suitable for a particular area and its specific conditions. This recommendation can

help farmers maximize their yield and profitability while also promoting sustainable agricultural

practices

The significance of the CRS extends beyond individual farmers, as it contributes to the broader

goals of sustainable agriculture and food security. By promoting the cultivation of crops best suited

to local conditions, the CRS aids in resource conservation, minimizes input wastage, and enhances

overall agricultural productivity.


Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool that empowers farmers to make smart choices

about crop selection, ultimately contributing to increased productivity and food security.
